## VR-Hopper
VR-Hopper is a tool which aims to give greater immersion when tuning Grasshopper graphs.

Given a grasshopper file we can see and manipulate the parametrically generated 3d model, together with its graph in VR.

When interacting with sliders in VR the model gets updated in real-time. Rudimentary gestures can be mapped to specific slider adjustments.
